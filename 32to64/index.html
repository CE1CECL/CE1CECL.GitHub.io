        <h2>How to upgrade 32-bit to 64-bit Windows (or do it reversed)</h2>
        <p>
            NOTE:
            [#] Means there a note about something, scroll to the bottom of the page to see the note.
        </p>
        <p>
            WARNING:
            When you downgrade from 64-bit to 32-bit, you MAY loose 64-bit programs and it is NOT recommended to do so. Do that at your own risk!
         </p>
        <p>
            NOTE:
            Don't Ask about the older Windows 7 and earlier setup, this trick doesn't work on it as Windows 7 uses checks after clicking on it (similar to Windows 10). And no, you can't copy the "$WINDOWS.~BT" folder over as it knows the Hard Disk ID Number. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Prerequisites:
            Windows XP (SP3), Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.0[1]
            ! Windows 10[3] and Windows 8.1[2] Does NOT work at the moment unless you are able to downgrade with/out lossing data !
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have XP 64-bit or x64 (SP2), you may need to find another runaround as there is no SP3 for those versions. There might be a registry hack but i don't know what to change! (it would be nice for Windows NT/2000 with KernelEx as well but its unlikely for 9x/ME)

            ! WARNING !
            I am not responsible for any damage or any data loss that occurred. Use this method at your own risk. THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL Its also worth mentioning that these 2 Windows 8 downloads are BETA builds, meaning it should not be used on primary systems! These builds also have a timebomb, but for me, they were broken.

            Known Bugs (as far as Windows XP)[5]:

        </p>

        <p>
            {1} Windows 8.0 IS the last known working version to downgrade because of (see [2]).
         </p>
        <p>
            {2} Windows 8.1 RTM or later downgrading to Windows 8.0 RTM or earlier is known to cause the following issue (see photo)
         </p>
        <img src="./17.PNG" id="logo" alt="17">
        <p>
            {3} Windows 10 build 9841 (TP) or later does not let you use the ShowHideControls trick for whatever reason (see video) It it known not occur on build 9870 because its just a windows 8.1 setup named "installprep.exe" instead of "setupprep.exe"!

            {4} You don't have to use these 2 specific builds in the downloads section, these just only work with Windows XP, but if you on something like Windows 7, You can probably use Windows 8 Consumer or Dev preview as these work just find at least for Windows 7/8.
         </p>
        <p>
            {5} The wallpaper from downgrading from Windows 8 Consumer preview to Windows 8 Dev preview didn't change and its only noticed in XP, its probably because Windows XP didn't come with an "AppData" folder while Windows vista and Up did, and it doesn't redirect, while "Documents and Settings" was changed to "Users", it actually has a "symbolic link".
         </p>
        <p>
            {6} They all go together and are just repeated. 
         </p>
        <p>
            {7} If you are just going from 32-bit to 32-bit or 64-bit to 64-bit, the steps are pretty much the same.
         </p>
        <p>
            {8} These photos are Windows XP SP3 (which is 32-bit only)
         </p>
        <p>
            It is also worth mentioning that you CANNOT upgrade windows 8.1 (10) 32-bit to 64-bit / 64-bit to 32-bit without downgrading first as it just goes to the "choose keyboard layout" instead of the "preparing your pc" screen. While you might be able to downgrade a couple of Windows 10 TP builds to 8.1, it would be useless anyways.
         </p>
        <p>
            Also, you should NOT put a 1703 (EXAMPLE) install.wim file into a 1709 (EXAMPLE) iso, as it will 1. rollback the install. 2. Get stuck somewhere at the end and you might need to reset.
         </p>
        <p>
            Whats Next:
            Windows XP SP2 (INCLUDING X64-64BIT) and earlier and Windows 8.1 and later support (INCLUDING WIN10).
